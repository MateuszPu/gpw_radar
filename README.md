# gpwRadar

This application was generated using JHipster, you can find documentation and help at [https://jhipster.github.io](https://jhipster.github.io).

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools (like
[Bower][] and [BrowserSync][]). You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

    npm install

We use [Grunt][] as our build system (Only if you want to use grunt, without it project works correctly). Install the grunt command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.

As the all front-end dependencies are not included on this repository. You have to install bower, go to catalog ../projectPath/gpw_radar, and run bower install command.
All dependencies should be downloaded by bower.

# Building for production

To optimize the gpwRadar client for production (here you will need grunt), run:

    mvn -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war --spring.profiles.active=prod

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

# Run from IDE

If you want to run project from IDE (Intellij in my case), you should navigate to gpw-radar module and run main method from Application class.
Before run you should edit run configuration: in [working directory][] you should provide [path to the gpw-radar module[][], instead of that application will be not working correctly.
